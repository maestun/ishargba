## Ishar GBA

Back in 2006 when learning C coding, I wrote a demo that replicates the dungeon crawling experience from Silmarils' 1992 game [Ishar: Legend of the Fortress](https://www.mobygames.com/game/ishar-legend-of-the-fortress).

However around 2008 I lost the source code (didn't know about version control back then, and my computer was stolen), but could retrieve the ROM that had been published on [PDRoms](https://pdroms.de/files/nintendo-gameboyadvance-gba/ishar-advance-v0-0-alpha).

This demo uses [GBFS](https://github.com/devkitPro/gba-tools/blob/master/src/gbfs.c) as a virtual file system. This repo contains the demo ROM as well as the code-only ROM, and all the assets.
